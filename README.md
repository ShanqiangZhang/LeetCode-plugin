# LeetCode-plugin
Enhance Your LeetCode Practice: Effortlessly Toggle Display of Images, Titles, and Examples.

# LeetCode Page Modifier
This is a Google Chrome extension designed to help LeetCode users improve their problem-solving skills by reducing reliance on problem examples and titles. This extension allows users to toggle the visibility of the problem example, title, and example image on LeetCode pages, thereby preventing passive memorization of problems and fostering a more active problem-solving approach.

# Motivation
When solving problems on LeetCode multiple times, it's easy to form a habit of relying on memorizing the problem's details, examples, and images, which isn't a good problem-solving habit. During actual interviews, problem examples are often not as clear as they are on LeetCode. This extension aims to provide a more realistic problem-solving environment by allowing users to hide problem examples, titles, and images, encouraging users to think more deeply about the problems themselves.
